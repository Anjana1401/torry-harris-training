Q1. What happens when you use .find() and .limit() combination ? 

        ?If we use both .find() and .limit() it will execute how many record lines which which will be specified by the user. 

ex. db.employee.find().limit(2) 

In this only 2 entire data will be executed. 

{ 

“name”:”Anjana”,”contact”:”1234” 

} 

{ 

“name”:”Sanjana”,”contact”:”4321” 

} 

Q2. Try out the operators- $gt, $lt, $gte, $lte, $ne. 

?db.employee.find({“salary”:{$gt:”25000”}}) 

?db.employee.find({“salary”:{$lt:”80000”}}) 

?db.employee.find({“salary”:{$gte:”25000”}}) 

?db.employee.find({“salary”:{$lte:”80000”}}) 

?db.employee.find({“salary”:{$ne:”40000”}}) 

Q3. Tryout the combination of .sort() with .limit() and see what happens. 

->db.employee.find().sort({“name”:1}).pretty().limit() 

Q4. What does .count() returns? 

?db.employee.find().count() 

This counts how many record are there. 

Q5. What happens if you update a record without giving all the field values? 

?All the values will be deleted except the value which we are updating. 

Q6. What happens if you update a match that does not exist? 

? The updated value will be created in that record. 

Q7. We have seen what insert does. Try out and find what upsert does? 

? Upsert is same like insert it will update and also will create a new record. 

Q8. What happens when you use ‘upsert:true’ with update statement? 

? Upsert:true  will update and also will create a new record if the value is not existing. 

db.employee.update({“name”=”Anjana”}:{$set:{“location”:”Bangalore”},{upsert:true})
